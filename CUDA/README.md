# CUDA 


## Topics

#### Multi-GPUs

The following are for students with time and interest to do additional study on topics related to this workshop.

* data paralle when using multi-GPUs: depth-first vs breadth-first approach: this [stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11673154/concurrency-in-cuda-multi-gpu-executions) provides several examples of CUDA code using both depth-first and breadth-first approaches.
* peer to peer memory transfers;  multiple GPUs on multiple nodes:  [This Supercomputing Conference Presentation](https://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/116711/sc11-multi-gpu.pdf) will give you a good starting point
